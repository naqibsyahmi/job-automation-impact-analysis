# üíºü§ñ The Impact of Technology on Job Automation and Employment Rates Analysis

## üìù Project Overview

## ‚ùóÔ∏èProblem Statement
1. The rise of AI adoption across industries has created **uncertainty about its impact** on salary levels and job growth opportunities.

2. The relationship between automation risk and required job skills remains **unclear**, making it difficult to identify roles at risk of redundancy.

3. There is a **lack of meaningful job classification** based on automation-related factors, hindering strategic planning for workforce development and upskilling.


## üéØ Project Objectives
1. **To determine** if varying levels of AI adoption across industries result in significant differences in employee salaries and job growth projections through statistical analysis and EDA.

2. **To assess** whether higher automation risk is statistically associated with specific required skills and lower salary outcomes.

3. **To classify** job profiles into meaningful segments based on AI adoption, automation risk, and company size tu support strategic workforce planning and upskilling efforts

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Python 3.10+**: Please ensure that Python 3.10 or higher is installed on your system before running this project. You can download the required version from the official website [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    https://github.com/naqibsyahmi/job-automation-impact-analysis.git
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment named **`venv`** in your project folder by running the following command:

    - **On Windows:**
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    - **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

    - **On Windows:**
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Once the virtual environment is successfully created and activated, run the following command in your terminal to install the required packages:

    - **On Windows:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    - **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the System

1. Navigate to the **`src`** folder by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    cd src
    ```

2. Run the following command to execute the notebook:

    ```
    jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute job_automation_impact.ipynb --inplace
    ```
